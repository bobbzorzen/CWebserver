            </figure>
            <p>This is a page about the webprogrammer Leopold "Bobbzorzen" Olsson.</p>

            <p>Bobbzorzen or "Bobba" as he is also refered to as, is a webprogramming student currently on his second year of his bachelours degree at the university of BTH. <br/>
            Bobba is a big fan of computers and IT in general.<br/> 
            On his spare time he usually wanders along the internet in search of interesting and entertaining material to partake in.<br/>
            But this is not all that he does with his time.<br/> 
            He also spends a good deal of it as a teaching assistant in some of the courses that he has already completed.</p>
            <p>Before Bobbzorzen started at the Bachelors program at BTH he finished a three year long education in IT with a focus on network administration and network security.
            During his frist year of this education he got to try out some programming in a languag called Pascal.<br/> 
            It did not take long for him to develop a fondness to programming even if all he could do at this time was change a few colors in a terminal and compute a few numbers.
            This led him to take several other programming courses.
            First of these other programming courses was a basic webdevelopment course where he was first introduced to the magics that is html, css and php.
            He quickly excelled at this class and soon took over the roll of helping his fellow classmates with their work whilst the teacher sat at his desk drinking coffe.
            This is also where he found his love of teaching, the joy he found in helping others with such an exciting subject as webbprogramming made his day.
            In paralell with this course he took a database course that focused on the use of mysql in conjuction with php.
            This opened up a whole new world of webprogramming and Bobbzorzen saw that the posibilities where endless.
            in his third year of the education he also studied some actionscript and made a few flash based games and took a course specificly in game programming but found that nothing could compare to the glorious ease and flexibility given in webbprogramming.
            This realisation was the key factor to his wish to attend the webbprogramming program at BTH so that he could further his knowledge of his favorite subject.
            </p>
            <p>
            At his first year at the program he soon figured out how little he actually knew since he had within the first weeks already passed the knowledge he brought from his 3 previous years and was learning new and exciting things every day. 
            He here picked up the basics in both C++ and Java programming and got a much greater understanding of the underlying mechanics of programming.
            </p>
            <p>
            At the begining of his second year Bobbzorzen got a part time job grading the new first graders assignments in courses he had already passed aswell as helping them during lab sessions. A great oppertunity combining his two great ambitions, programming and teaching.
            During the end of his second year he got yet another part time job at a small software company situated next to the campus.
            At this job he got to work with Javascript and Python and several frameworks related to these two languages.
            This was a hectic time since he had full time studies with a major project and 2 part time jobs which ment that he went to schol at about 8 every morning only to return home at 8 in the evening. <br/>
            <br/>
            This brings us up to date where he is currently in his third and final year at BTH and is taking 4 courses, this Javascript course, the python counterpart aswell as two campus courses, one is a course on Programming in the UNIX environment the other is an introductory security course.<br/>
            </p>
